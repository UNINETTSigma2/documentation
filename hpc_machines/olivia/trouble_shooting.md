(Olivia frequently asked questions)=

# Olivia frequently asked questions (FAQ):

## 1. Where is my Project storage area?

Olivia doesn’t have permanent project areas and user work areas. Instead, each project has a project work area.

On Olivia, each project has an area /cluster/work/projects/nnXXXXk. The area has no set disk or inode quota, is private to the project and only accessible by the project’s members.
