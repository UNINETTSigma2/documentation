# Fram

Named after the Norwegian arctic expedition ship [Fram](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fram),
the new Linux cluster hosted at [UiT Arctic University of Norway](https://uit.no/startsida) is a shared resource for research computing capable of 1.1 PFLOP/s
theoretical peak performance.

Fram is a distributed memory system which consists of 1004 dual socket and 2
quad socket nodes, interconnected with a high-bandwidth low-latency Infiniband
network. The interconnect network is organized in an island topology, with 9216
cores in each island. Each standard compute node has two 16-core Intel Broadwell
chips (2.1 GHz) and 64 GiB memory. In addition, 8 larger memory nodes with 512
GiB RAM and.
The total number of compute cores is 32256.
