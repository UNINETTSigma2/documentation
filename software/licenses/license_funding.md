# Changes in Sigma2 funding policy

Currently the cost for a number of licenses for application software is carried by the Metacenter, as shown in the [list of licensed software at the Metacenter](license-list.md). This will change gradually, and from autum 2020 the Metacenter will not fund licenses for application software (e.g. ADF/BAND, Crystal, Gaussian, GaussView, Molpro).

For these codes and the corresponding research groups and research communities the Metacenter will offer consulting for pooling costs and for the maintenance of common license certificates and servers. The Metacenter will help these communities to set up coordination points to simplify paperwork and save costs.

**Note that the Metacenter will continue to fund licenses for code development tools (compilers, debuggers, profiling tools) (software that belongs to the field tagged "Code Development") - these base tools are not affected by the planned change in funding policy.**

Access to and using of codes will be influenced the following way:

* **ADF/BAND** - the license is renewed every second year, and the software requires valid license to run. Software in the ADF/BAND software suite will cease to work on Metacenter installations from September 1st 2020 unless alternatively funded.
* **Amber** - the license is for release 11 of the code and is valid for the lifetime of the software. Currently this is not installed on any of our clusters. Please let us know if you need this.
* **Crystal** - the license is for release 14 of the code and is valid for the lifetime of the software. There will be no change in access after September 2020, but there will be no updates to newer versions unless alternatively funded.
* **Gaussian/GaussView** - the license is valid for the lifetime of the software, there will be no change in access after September 2020, but there will be no updates unless alternatively funded.
* **NBO6/7** - the license is valid for the lifetime of the software, there will be no change in access after September 2020, but there will be no updates unless alternatively funded.
* **Schrodinger** - license is renewed anually and the software requires a valid license to run. Most of the software in the Schrodinger suite, apart from the free releases of Maestro, PyMOL and Desmond, will cease to work on Metacenter installations from November 2020 unless alternatively funded. Note that there is a gradual decrease of funding contribution from Sigma2, for 2019/2020 there will be a 15% overall contribution (not more than 7k USD) and from 2020/2021 no contribuion at all. *Thus, if the user community decides to discontinue their contribution to the overall license costs, the renewal of the license may end already October 2019.*
* **Turbomole** - the license is valid for the lifetime of the software, paying an annual maintenance fee of about 10% of license cost. There will be no change in access to currently installed software after September 2020, but there will be no updates unless alternatively funded.

**Note also that even if there are alternative funding of some of the above mentioned software, access policy may probably be altered since funding will typically move from national/community to group level.**
