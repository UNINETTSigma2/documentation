# The Schrödinger molecular modeling package
Schrodinger is a scientific leader in computational chemistry, providing software solutions and services for life 
sciences and materials research. 

The following Schrodinger suites are available on SAGA:
* Schrodinger/2021-2-intel-2020b
* Schrodinger/2021-3-intel-2020b 

## Follow these steps to use the Schrodinger software package on SAGA:

1. [Preparing the schrodinger.hosts file](schrodinger_hosts.md)
2. [Using the Schrodinger suite](schrodinger_usage.md)
3. [Schrodinger job control facility](job_control.md)
4. [Tuning Schrodinger jobs](tuning.md)


**NOTE:** Before running any jobs, you need to make a copy of the schrodinger.hosts file as described [here](schrodinger_hosts.md).

**NOTE 2:** Schrodinger uses its own wrapper on top of the SLURM queuing system. Please take the time to ensure that
you understand how this works: [Schrodinger job control facility](job_control.md).

## License and access
The Schrödinger suite is currently available on `SAGA` and the license is paid by the users.
