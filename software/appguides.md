# Application guides

For a general explanation on how to make an application available for use, the
module system, and information about changes in application software see
{ref}`module-scheme`.

```{important}
If you are using an application not on the list, or if you are using an
application that can take advantage of GPU compute, we would like to hear from
you so that we can document the application.
