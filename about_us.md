# Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services

The Norwegian research high-performance computing and storage infrastructure is
maintained by [NRIS](https://sigma2.no/nris) (formerly known as *the
Metacenter*), which is a joint collaboration between [UiO](https://www.uio.no),
[UiB](https://www.uib.no), [NTNU](https://www.ntnu.no), [UiT](https://uit.no),
and [Sigma2](https://www.sigma2.no/).

We provide valuable resources for the research communities. Not only do we
provide state-of-the art {ref}`compute <hardware-overview>` and {ref}`storage
facilities <nird>`, backed by {ref}`support <support-line>` and a guarantee
that your data always stays in Norway. But possibly more important is
{ref}`easy access <extended-support>` to a wide selection of competences that
can assist, realize or take your project to the next level.

This website (<https://documentation.sigma2.no/>) primarily holds documentation
of resources we provide. For more general information and service overview,
please also see <https://www.sigma2.no>.


## Compute, storage, pre/post-processing, visualization, machine learning

We offer compute resources {ref}`betzy`, {ref}`fram`, and {ref}`saga`, storage
resources {ref}`nird`, as well as the [NIRD
Toolkit](https://www.sigma2.no/nird-toolkit) platform for pre- and
post-processing analysis, data intensive processing, visualization, artificial
intelligence, and machine learning.

Researchers also have access to {ref}`lumi` through the LUMI consortium.
