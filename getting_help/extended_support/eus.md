# Extended User Support

For smaller adoptions, optimisations, and changes which are exceeding ordinary
support, you can **ask support staff for extended user support** (formerly called
mini Advanced User Support).

Extended user support can also be initiated by the
support staff, typically if they see that this could be of a relevance, e.g.
in connection with ineffective jobs. In this case you will be contacted by the
support staff and offered the extended user support.

Extended user support projects are not requiring any funding or in-kind from
the project or user. The total amount of work effort must not exceed **5
working days**.

A likely outcome is that extended user support could lead to
formulation of a proper {ref}`extended-support-aus`, which needs an application and evaluation,
but in turn could assign a few months of dedicated work from one of our
experts
([more documentation about the advanced user support](https://www.sigma2.no/advanced-user-support)).
