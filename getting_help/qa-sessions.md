# Open Question & Answer Sessions for All Users

## Learn new tricks and ask & discuss questions

Meet the HPC staff, discuss problems and project ideas, give feedback or
suggestions on how to improve services, and get advice for your
projects.

Join us on [Zoom](https://uit.zoom.us/j/65284253551), get yourself a
coffee or tea and have a chat. It doesn't matter from which institute or
university you are, you are **welcome to join at any time**.

This time we will start with a **short seminar about “Helpful Tools &
Services we offer you might not know about”**. Afterwards we have the
open question and answer session.

We can talk about: - Problems/questions regarding the Stallo/Vilje
shutdown and migration - Questions regarding data storage and management
- Help with programming and software management - Help with project
organization and data management - Anything else If you think you might
have a challenging question or topics for us, you can also send them to
us before, so we can come prepared and help you better. If you have
