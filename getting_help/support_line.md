Behind these addresses are issue trackers (ticket system) and you will get an
automatic reply first and can expect response from our staff within hours
during normal work-hours, or at the latest the following working day (except
holidays).

When replying to email from the support line **please do not change the email subject**.

However, for a new problem, **do not reply to emails with unrelated subjects** (and
ticket numbers) as this can be confusing for us.


## This information will help us to answer faster

We get many requests for help which are too vague to give a useful response.
So, when sending us a question, please answer these questions and you’ll get
the fastest useful response:

- **Has it ever worked?** (If so, what has changed?)
- **What are you trying to accomplish?** (Your ultimate goal, not current technical obstacle.)
- **What did you do?** (Be specific enough to be reproducible - copy and paste exact commands you run, scripts, inputs, output messages, etc.)

If you don’t know something, it’s OK, just do your best and we’ll help from
there! You can also chat with us to brainstorm about issues in general.

## What can you expect from the support line

You can expect efficiency and a friendly and competent staff with decades
of combined experience on supercomputers.

However, the load on the support staff can sometimes be significant and we may
need to prioritize issues.  In busy times we may not be able to help you with
questions that would be better addressed to your local IT departments.

Domain-specific questions may be beyond our expertise. However, we maintain a
few application liaisons for very heavility used programs and domains. We also
encourage you to check our page about {ref}`user-communities` to connect with
other researchers using the same program as you.
