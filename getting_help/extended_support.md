# Extended support

NRIS provides resources (computers, networks, storage systems, and a
software stack) that are adapted to the current research being performed in
Norway. This provides the community with a valuable resource.

However, what we believe is even more valuable is the fact that you as a user
have easy access to a **broad selection of competences and domain expertise**
that can be utilized to improve the quality, reproducibility, and efficiency of
your current flow of work. Our staff have the competence to assist you to
address that competitive edge you want to reach or keep.

Whether that challenge is small, large, complex or trivial does not matter,
please reach out ({ref}`support-line`) and we will find a common ground
for collaboration. Using that as an entry point we can figure out together how,
who and what kind of competences we should involve to address the challenge.
And **for the most part this is free of charge**.

A few examples of what we can offer you:

- Introduce you and your team to modern practices with respect to code
  development, maintenance, and support.

- Improving the quality of your code base.

- Contribute to porting your code from your laptop/desktop to high-performance
  compute facilities and GPU resources.

- Optimizing your code to run more efficiently (in terms of run time and memory demand).

- Assist in developing and facilitating for more automation, reproducibility,
  and high-throughput possibilities in your flow of work. For instance
  developing workflows that ensures data provenance.

- Competence and insight that sits close to the domain topic of interest.

Below you can find more detailed information on how we can assist you.
Do not hesitate to contact us ({ref}`support-line`) if you are unsure which
