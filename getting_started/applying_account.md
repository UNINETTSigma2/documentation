# How do I get an account?

To apply for an account to be able to log in and use our compute and storage
resources, go to the
[user application form](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application).

For more a step-by-step guide, follow the documentation from
[here](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account).

After you obtain an account, you may need to apply for or connect to an existing
{ref}`compute or storage allocation <applying-computing-storage>`.
