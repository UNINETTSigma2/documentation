## I would like to change my shell. What do I do?

`bash` is the only supported shell by the Metacenter. You may however
change to another shell of your preference as long as you deal on your own with
problems which might arise as a result of it.  For temporary use, you can
simply call the new shell from bash. For persistent change, please contact
support.
