# Applying for computing and storage

Applications for computing and storage resources should be submitted through NRIS Administration System (MAS).


```{warning}
Resources on the national e-infrastructure are granted on a period basis and
the **allocation periods have deadlines**.

Please check <https://www.sigma2.no/apply-e-infrastructure-resources#deadlines>
to find information about when the next allocation period starts and to not
miss the next application deadline.
```


## If you do not have a compute (nn) or storage (ns) project

Please refer to the information on [this page](https://www.sigma2.no/apply-e-infrastructure-resources) for more details 
and follow the link that takes you to the application form.


## If you already have a compute (nn) or storage (ns) project

To apply for additional compute or storage resources to an **existing project
allocation**, we offer a dedicated and [simplified
procedure](https://www.sigma2.no/apply-e-infrastructure-resources#howtoapplyforextra).
