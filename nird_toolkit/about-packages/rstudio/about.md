# Usage

## How to use RStudio
For a general tutorial on how to use RStudio,
see [RStudio 101](https://dss.princeton.edu/training/RStudio101.pdf).
For a webinar with an in-depth explanation of RStudio can be found, see
[RStudio webinars](https://www.rstudio.com/collections/rstudio-essentials/).

## Serving Shiny applications
The rstudio package has built-in support for serving [Shiny web applications](https://shiny.rstudio.com/).
Shiny can be used to create interactive web applications directly in R.
By default, a collection of sample applications are hosted on `shiny-<your application URL here>`.

![Shiny default apps](./rstudio_shiny.png)

By default, all shiny apps are served from the `/srv/shiny-server`
directory. In order to add and host a new app, copy your application to
`/srv/shiny-server`. One way of doing this is using the terminal which is built
into Rstudio. The terminal can accessed through the `Terminal` tab, which is
found besides the `Console` tab in the upper part of the UI.

For information about how to create new Shiny apps,
see [Learn Shiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/).

### How to add new packages
In case you are missing some packages from the default application image, you can add those packages yourself by creating a custom docker image.
See   {ref}`this tutorial <custom-docker-image>` for generic instructions on how to add packages.

After having read the tutorial above, you can use the dockerfile below as a starting point when creating the dockerfile that adds new packages.
```
# See the value of dockerImage in
#
#   https://github.com/UninettSigma2/helm-charts/blob/master/repos/stable/rstudio/values.yaml
#
# to determine the latest base image


FROM sigma2as/rstudio-server:<use latest tag here>

# Install system packages
USER root
RUN apt update && apt install -y emacs && rm -rf /tmp/downloaded_packages

# Install R packages
USER rstudio
RUN install2.r randomForest
```
