# NIRD Data Lake

NIRD Data Lake is a storage service designed for storing and sharing large volumes of less active data - datasets that are 
no longer being processed frequently but still need to be kept, accessed or shared.
The service supports both file and object access, allowing flexible integration with research workflows and external systems.

## When to use NIRD Data Lake
Use NIRD Data Lake when:

- You have large volumes of data that are no longer heavily used, but you need to keep them.
- You want to store both structured and unstructured data and provide access via object storage (S3).
- You need a cost-effective solution for preserving and managing large datasets.

See the [NIRD](nird) documentation for further technical and access details.
