# NIRD TS vs NIRD DL

NIRD consists of two separate storage systems, namely Tiered Storage (NIRD TS) and 
Data Lake (NIRD DL).

NIRD TS has several tiers spanned by single filesystem and designed for performance and used mainly for active project data.

NIRD DL has a flat structure, designed mainly for less active data, sharing data across multiple projects, and interfacing with external storages.

Both are based on IBM Elastic Storage System. 


## Architecture comparison

| |  NIRD TS  |  NIRD DL  |
| :------------- | :------------- | :------------- |
| Tiers | Performance and capacity tiers<br> Automatic, transparent tiering<br>Dedicated pools for metadata | Flat architecture (no tiers)  |
| Designed for | - active project data<br>- data processing<br>- AI workloads| - less active data<br>- data libraries<br>- sharing data across multiple projects<br>- interfacing with external storages |
| Data integrity secured by | - erasure coding<br> - snapshots <br> - backup[^1] | - erasure coding<br> - snapshots | 

## Functionality comparison
