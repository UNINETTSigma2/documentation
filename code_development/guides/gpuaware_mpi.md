# Incorporating MPI into GPU-directive models with a GPU-awareness approach


# Summary 

We present a descriptive implementation of a hybrid approach in which the MPI (message passing interface) communication framework is combined with either OpenACC or OpenMP application programming interfaces (APIs). The implementation is based on solving the 2D (two-dimension)-Laplace equation in a mini-application form. A special focus will be on performing point-to-point (e.g. `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv`) and collective (e.g. `MPI_Allreduce`) operations either between a pair of GPU-devices with the GPU-hardware support or by passing through a CPU-host memory. These two scenarios are referred to as GPU-aware MPI and GPU-non-aware MPI, respectively. Both scenarios will be addressed in the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** models and their performance will be evaluated and analysed. Interesting enough, the performance is found to be increased by a factor of 10 when enabling the GPU-aware support on the 
[LUMI-G GPU nodes](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/hardware/lumig/) and by almost a factor of 30 compared to the case when MPI alone is considered.  

By the end of this tutorial, we expect the readers to learn about

- Implementing a pure MPI using a blocking mode of communication.  
- Implementing the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** models, and specifically: 
  - Defining the concept of direct memory access.
  - Setting up a GPU-device to be assigned to an MPI rank.   
  - Implementing MPI operations between GPUs with and without using a CPU-host memory as a staging point.
  - Compiling the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** applications on different HPC systems.

# Introduction

Parallel computing involving communication between heterogenous systems, especially CPU (central processing unit) and GPU (graphics processing unit), permits to significantly improve the performance of computations on modern HPC (high-performance computing) systems. This in turn allows us to address large scientific computational problems, which would not be possible using conventional CPU-based approaches. Such computational problems can benefit from available GPU-programing models to further accelerate the computation over multiple GPU-devices. Here, although the asynchronous OpenACC and OpenMP offer the potential to carry out computations across multiple GPUs, the partition of the computation is limited to a single GPU node. Note that the asynchronous OpenMP relies on the compiler support. Extending the computation to explore multiple GPU nodes requires combining MPI (message passing interface) with additional GPU-programming models, such as OpenACC and OpenMP application programming interfaces (APIs) and CUDA. In this tutorial, we focus on the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** applications. 

Combining MPI with OpenACC or OpenMP offloading APIs offers the potential to fully utilizing the capacity of multiple GPUs within multiple GPU partitions in modern clusters and supercomputers. Moreover, it has the advanatge of reducing the computing time caused by transferring data via the host-memory during heterogenous communications, thus rendering the HPC applications efficient. In this contetx, it has been shown that integrating [GPU-awareness](https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1109/ICPP.2013.17) into MPI library improves the performance of scientific applications. This tutorial is thus motivated by the need of guiding readers, who are familiar with MPI, in porting their MPI-based codes to heterogenous systems and towards exploring exascale platforms, such as the [supercomputer LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/).

In this tutorial, we will cover two scenarios: a scenario in which an MPI library can directly access a GPU-device memory (i.e GPU-aware MPI); and a scenario in which there is no interaction between an MPI library and a GPU-device (i.e. GPU-non-aware MPI). The implementation will be provided for both the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** APIs.

This descriptive tutorial is organized as follows: In {ref}`section I <implementation-of-mpi-alone>`, we describe the implementation of the low-level MPI alone using an application based on solving the Laplace equation. In {ref}`section II <implementation-of-a-gpu-awareness-approach>`, we extend the MPI-application to incorporate a GPU-awareness approach. This is done by combining MPI with OpenACC/OpenMP AIPs. Here we will address both GPU-accelerator and non-accelerator -aware MPI library (i.e. MPI with direct memory access vs MPI without direct memory access). 
{ref}`Section III <performance-analysis-on-lumi-g-eap>` is devoted to the performance analysis. {ref}`Section IV <gpuaware-conclusion>` concludes the tutorial.

# Implementation of MPI alone  

The MPI programming model is widely used in the scientific community for intensive parallel computing that requires distributed memory among multiple nodes. In this section, we implement the low-level [MPI standard](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf) approach to parallelise our `Fortran` application, which is based on solving the Laplace equation in a uniform 2D-grid. Details about the numerical method can be found [here](https://documentation.sigma2.no/code_development/guides/converting_acc2omp/openacc2openmp.html). 

<div align="center">

![Fig1](GPUawareMPI/Fig1.png)

**Fig. 1.** *Schematic representation of an MPI-scheme, in which the data that are initially stored in an array of size (nx,ny) (**Fig. 1(a)**) are distributed among different MPI-processes ranging from 0 to nproc-1 (**Fig. 1(b)**). Here nproc is the total number of MPI-processes and npy is the size of the array on y-direction on each MPI-process (nyp=ny/nproc).*
</div>

In this tutorial, we consider a simplest scenario, in which the data, which are initially of dimension {math}`n_{x}` x {math}`n_{y}` (cf. **Fig. 1(a)**) are subdivided only along the y-direction. This results into sub-arrays of dimension {math}`n_{x}` x {math}`n_{yp}`, where {math}`n_{yp}`={math}`n_{y}`/nproc. Here each sub-array is assigned to an MPI process as shown in **Fig. 1(b)**. In a realistic problem, it is recommended to carry out a 2D domain decomposition along both x and y directions. Our simplified scenario, however has the advantage of transforming a 2D-problem into a 1D-problem in terms of implementing a parallel algorithm. Such a simplification is a key element when making tutorials.

A starting point in this implementation is to generate initial conditions (ICs) and distribute them among different processes in a communicator group. The simplest way to do so is to use the `MPI_Scatter` operation, which distributes the generated data from the process 0 (root) to processes labeled *myid* in the source code (i.e. the rank of an MPI process). This is defined in the range [*myid=0*, *myid=nproc-1*], where *nproc* is the total number of processes. It is worth mentioning that initiating the data in parallel among all MPI-ranks is recommended for scalability reasons. Therefore, an alternative to the `MPI_Scatter` operation is to use a blocking/non-blocking mode of communication as described below

```Fortran
if(myid.eq.0) then
       allocate(f_send(nx,nyp))

       do k=1,nproc-1
         Call RANDOM_NUMBER(f_send(:,:))
         
         call MPI_Send(f_send(:,:),nsend,MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,k,tag,&
                       MPI_COMM_WORLD, ierr)
       enddo
       deallocate(f_send)

else
        call MPI_Recv(f(:,:),nsend,MPI_DOUBLE_PRECISION,0, &
                      tag,MPI_COMM_WORLD, status,ierr)
endif
```
This piece of code should be adapted to fit a specific scenario.

The ICs we consider are random and are generated by the routine `RANDOM_NUMBER`. Note that MPI-programs, in general, require incorporating the mpi module (i.e. `use mpi`) or including the header file mpif.h (i.e. `include ‘mpif.h’`). In our source code, the meaning of each MPI function is included briefly as a comment in the code itself.  

A subsequent step is to iterate the ICs using an appropriate iterative scheme as described in our previous [tutorial](https://documentation.sigma2.no/code_development/guides/converting_acc2omp/openacc2openmp.html) (see also [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/2201.11811)). In an iterative scheme, the distributed data along the y-direction needs to be updated (i.e. halo exchange); this is because the data at the boundaries of each sub-array in each MPI process are initially set to zero. For instance, computing the new array *f_k(:,1)* for each MPI-process requires updating the elements *f(:,0)* initially set for each process; similarly for *f(:,nyp+1)* (see the lines 82-91 in the code below and the equation in **Fig. 2**). A key element here is to transfer the data at the boundaries between the neighboring MPI processes at each iteration. This is schematically illustrated in **Fig. 2**. This is transformed into a few MPI lines using a blocking communication mode characterized by the MPI functions `MPI_Send()` and `MPI_Recv()`, as described in the source code below. The blocking mode here means that the **send** and **receive** operations do not return until the message data is available to be re-used. In other words, the operations are completed once the message is buffered.  Note that there are three additional blocking modes for the **send** operation. These modes, however, are not addressed in the present tutorial. We thus refer readers to the [MPI documentation](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf) for further description. 

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpi.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 80-103
```

The inconvenient of the blocking mode is related to the possibility of causing the program to deadlock (i.e. the MPI message cannot be completed). An alternative to the blocking mode that avoids MPI deadlock is to use a [non-blocking](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf) concept. The latter has another advanatge, which relies on enabling overlapping between communication and computation. In this type of mode, the MPI-functions `MPI_Send()` and `MPI_Recv()` are replaced with `MPI_Isend()` and `MPI_Irecv()` respectively, and should be followed by the function `MPI_Wait()`.

<div align="center">

![Fig2](GPUawareMPI/Fig2.png)

**Fig. 2.** *Schematic representation of an MPI-scheme, in which the boundary data are transferred between the neighbouring MPI-processes in a point-to-point operation before (**Fig. 2(a)**) and after collecting theme (**Fig. 2(b)**). The form of the equation is also displayed in the same figure for the sake of clarity*.
</div>

Updating the data at the boundaries is a key difficulty in this example, as it requires re-collecting the data from the neighbouring MPI processes to reconstruct a new array at each iteration. The computed maximum between the new and the old arrays is done using the `MPI_Allreduce` operation, in which the result is returned to all MPI processes of the specified communicator group. 

To check the correctness of the results, one can compute the sum of all the elements or eventually display the converged data either in 1D or 2D for comparison. For this reason, we introduce the `MPI_Gather` operation, which allows aggregating the data from each MPI process and make them available only in the root process. This option, however, might become time consuming and eventually might lead to segmentation error when increasing the size of the data.

## Compilation process of an MPI-application

Here we describe the compilation process of a pure MPI-application on different HPC systems using the OpenMPI and Intel MPI compilers on the clusters [Saga](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html) and [Betzy](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/betzy.html) and the Cray compiler on the [supercomputer LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/). The compiler wrappers associated with the OpenMPI, Intel MPI and Cray compilers are `mpif90`, `mpiifort` and `ftn`, respectively.

### On the Saga and Betzy clusters

The following procedure is valid for both Saga and Betzy clusters. Here is an example of modules to be loaded.

`````{tabs}

```
````
````{group-tab} Intel MPI module

```console
$ module load impi/2021.4.0-intel-compilers-2021.4.0
```
````
`````

The compilation process is described according to the chosen compiler.

`````{tabs}

```
````
````{group-tab} Intel MPI compiler

                             #On Betzy the mem should not be specified for a pure MPI-code
srun ./laplace.mpiompi
```

### On the supercomputer LUMI

On the supercomputer LUMI, an MPI module is loaded in the environment `cray-mpich` (as described 
[here](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/development/compiling/prgenv/#compile-an-mpi-program))

```console
$ module load cray-mpich
```
The syntax of the compilation process of an MPI code using the Cray compiler can be expressed as:

```console

# Implementation of a GPU-awareness approach

In this section we extend our MPI-application to incorporate the OpenACC and OpenMP offloading APIs targeting both NVIDIA and AMD GPU-accelerators. A special focus here is to address the concept of **GPU-aware MPI** library (or MPI with GPU-direct memory access) and **GPU-non-aware MPI** (or MPI without GPU-direct access). In the following we implement this concept for both the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** APIs. Details about the implementation of OpenACC and OpenMP APIs alone are provided in our previous 
[tutorial](https://documentation.sigma2.no/code_development/guides/converting_acc2omp/openacc2openmp.html). 

The GPU-awareness approach can simply mean how to make a GPU-device memory aware or not aware of the existence of an MPI-library, such that a direct or non-direct access to the library can be accomplished. Before addressing this concept, it is worthwhile *(i)* defining the mechanism of direct-memory access and *(ii)* introducing how to establish a connection between each MPI rank and a specific GPU-device. Here, we are in the situation in which a host and a device have a distinct memory (i.e. non-shared memory device).

## Direct memory access

[Direct memory access](https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/computer-science/direct-memory-access) (DMA) (see also this [Ref.](https://www.akkadia.org/drepper/cpumemory.pdf), which provides an overview about memory) is a mechanism by which the data can be transferred between an I/O device and a memory system without an involvement of the processor itself. It thus allows two separated processors to directly access the memory of each other via a network. This has the advantage of reducing latency and increasing throughput, which is relevant particularly for modern HPC systems. As an example, the DMA mechanism is used in data management between a CPU-host and a GPU-device as we shall see later.

## Assigning a MPI rank to a GPU device

Managing multiple GPU-devices by combining MPI and OpenACC or OpenMP APIs requires as a first step assigning each MPI rank to a single GPU-device. In other words, one needs to determine which processes are within a specifc CPU-node that is connecetd with the nearest GPU-node. This permits to minimize latency, and it is particularly relevant when running an application on multiple nodes. This procedure can be done by splitting the world communicator into subgroups of communicators (or sub-communicators), which is done via the routine `MPI_COMM_SPLIT_TYPE()`. Here each sub-communicator contains processes running on the same node. These processes have a shared-memory region defined via the argument `MPI_COMM_TYPE_SHARED` (see [here](https://www.mpi-forum.org/docs/mpi-4.0/mpi40-report.pdf) for more details). Calling the routine `MPI_COMM_SPLIT_TYPE()` returns a sub-communicator (labelled "host_comm" in the source code) created by each subgroup, in which each MPI-rank can be assigned to a single GPU-device (see the lines 97-101 in the code below).  

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiacc_noaware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 97-110
```

In **OpenACC** API, the host-device connection is established by specifying the runtime library routine `acc_set_device_num(host_rank,deviceType)`. The latter contains two arguments "host_rank" and "deviceType": the first argument determines which device an MPI rank will be assigned to, and the second one returns the GPU-device type to be used. These are indicated by the lines 104-110 in the source code described above. Similarly in **OpenMP** API, the connection is defined via the function `omp_set_default_device(host_rank)`.

## GPU-non-aware MPI library

The MPI implementation without GPU-direct memory access or GPU-non-aware MPI means that calling an MPI routine from an OpenACC or OpenMP API requires updating the data before and after an MPI call. In this scenario, the data are copied back and forth between a host and a device before and after each MPI call. In the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC**, the procedure is defined by specifying the directive `update host()` (see the code line 132) for copying the data from a device to a host before an MPI call, and by the directive `update device()` specified after an MPI call for copying the data back to a device (see the code line 160). The implementation is shown in this piece of code described below
```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiacc_noaware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 131-169
```

A similar concept is adopted in the hybrid **MPI-OpenMP**. Here, updating the data in connection with an MPI call is done by specifying the directives `update device() from()` ( see the line 128) and `update device() to()` (see the line 162), respectively, for copying the data from a device to a host and back to the device. This is illustrated in the lines of code shown below.
```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiomp_noaware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 127-163
```

Although this approach is simple to implement, it might lead to a lower performance caused by an explicit transfer of data between a host and a device before and after calling an MPI routine. Furthermore, the approach is synchronous, which does not allow overlapping between MPI-based computation and OpenACC/OpenMP operations. An alternative to this approach is to use the GPU-aware MPI as described in the next section. 

## GPU-aware MPI library

The concept of the GPU-awareness MPI relies on the possibility of moving data that reside in a GPU-device memory without necessarily using a CPU-host memory as an intermediate buffer (see e.g. [here](https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2642769.2642773)). This approach enables an MPI library to directly access a GPU-device memory, which in turn permits to transfer data from one GPU to another GPU, thus reducing the communication and computing time of data between different MPI processes.

In our example discussed above, the data at the boundaries of each MPI process reside in a GPU-device, as they have already been copied to. In the GPU-non-aware MPI concept, these data must be updated on a CPU-host and copyied back to a GPU-device at each iteration. In the GPU-aware MPI, however, these data can be communicated between a pair of GPUs witout necessarily passing through a CPU-host memory. This approach is supported by recent versions of MPI libraries such as [Open MPI](https://www.open-mpi.org/). The idea here is that when a pointer to a GPU-device is passed to an MPI call, the MPI library automatically sets up a GPU memory for processing data. This implementation might require a newer version of [CUDA driver and toolkit](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=runcuda).

In the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC**, the concept is defined by combining the directive `host_data` together with the clause `use_device(list_array)`. This combination enables the access to the arrays listed in the the clause `use_device(list_array)` from the 
[host](https://www.nvidia.com/docs/IO/116711/OpenACC-API.pdf). The list of arrays, which should be already present in a GPU-device memory, are directly passed to an MPI routine without a need of a staging host-memory for copying the data. Note that for copying data, we use here [unstructured data](https://www.openacc.org/sites/default/files/inline-files/OpenACC_Programming_Guide_0_0.pdf) blocks characterized by the directives `enter data` and `exit data`, unlike in the previous section, in which the structured data locality is considered. The unstructured data has the advantage of allowing to allocate and deallocate arrays within a data region. 

In our example, the GPU-aware MPI support with OpenACC is illustrated in connection with the MPI operations `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` as described in lines 127-160 (see the code below) and the operation `MPI_Allreduce` in lines 184-192 (see the code below). Note that not all MPI functions are supported by the GPU-awareness concept (see [here](https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=runcuda) for more details). In the lines 133-160, the boundary data stored in the array *f(:,:)* are present in GPUs and are passed directly to the `MPI_Send()` and `MPI_Recv()` functions. Therefore, the operations `MPI_Send` and `MPI_Recv` are performed between GPUs without passing through a CPU-host. A similar picture occurs in connection with the `MPI_Allreduce()` function, in which the `MPI_Allreduce` operation is performed between a pair of GPUs. In the latter picture, we have noticed a slight increase of the computing time (a few ms) compared to the case when the `MPI_Allreduce` operation is carried out between CPUs instead of GPUs. This is because the computed maximum (see the lines 174-182), which is present in a CPU-host is copied back to a GPU-device at each iteration before perfoming the `MPI_Allreduce` operation between GPUs.  

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiacc_aware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 127-160
```

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiacc_aware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 174-182
```

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiacc_aware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 184-192
```

The same concept is adopted in the hybrid **MPI-OpenMP** API. The GPU-aware MPI support with OpenMP can be implemented via the directive [`target data use_device_ptr(ptr-list)`](https://www.openmp.org/spec-html/5.1/openmpsu65.html). Here each array specified in the clause `use_device_ptr()` is a pointer to an object that is accessible on a GPU-device. The implementation is shown in the lines 127-160 of the code below, in which the MPI functions `MPI_Send()` and `MPI_Recv()` can be performed between a pair of GPUs. Similarly for the `MPI_Allreduce` operation shown in the lines 184-192. 

By comparing the syntax of the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** API with that of the **MPI-OpenMP** API, one can see that the porting procedure of one API to another is straightforward.  

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiomp_aware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 127-160
```

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: GPUawareMPI/src/laplace_mpiomp_aware.f90
   :language: Fortran
   :lines: 184-192
```

```{note}
Note that the GPU-aware MPI support needs to be enabled by setting the environment variable `MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1` to 1 or to 0 to not enable it, as described in the compilation process.
```

## Compilation process of **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** applications

Our hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** applications have been tested on both the cluster 
[Betzy](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/betzy.html) (4xNVIDIA A100 GPUs connected by NVLink) and the supercomputer 
[LUMI-EAP](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/eap/) (Early Access Platform) (4xAMD MI100 GPUs connected by the Infinity Fabric Link). The compilation process is thus described below according to which HPC system is used. 

### On the cluster Betzy

We use a version of OpenMPI library (MPI-3 implementation), which has some supports for GPUs and which enables moving data residing on GPU-memory, in which a GPU-awareness concept is supported in the [Betzy](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/betzy.html) cluster. Note that this concept is not supported in the [Saga](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html) cluster, and therefore, only the GPU-non-aware MPI concept is supported. For completeness, we refer readers to a tutorial, in which a 
[GPU-non-aware MPI](https://documentation.sigma2.no/code_development/guides/openacc_mpi.html) was implemented in the `C` language. 

The modules to be loaded are listed here according to which cluster is considered.

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} Betzy

```console
$ module load OpenMPI/4.1.1-NVHPC-22.1-CUDA-11.4.1
```
````
````{group-tab} Saga

```console
$ module load OpenMPI/4.0.3-PGI-20.4-GCC-9.3.0
```
````
`````

The compilation process of the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** applications is described below

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenACC**

```console
$ mpif90 -fast -acc -Minfo=accel -o laplace.mpiacc laplace_mpiacc.f90
```
````
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenMP**

```console
$ mpifort -mp=gpu -Minfo=mp -o laplace.mpiomp laplace_mpiomp.f90
```
````
`````

Where the flag `-mp=gpu` enables **OpenMP** targeting GPU. The option `-Minfo=mp` provides compiler diagnostic of **OpenMP**. It is also optional to specify the compute capability by adding the flag `-gpu=cc60` for NVIDIA P100 GPU 
([Saga](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html)) and `-gpu=cc80` for A100 GPU 
([Betzy](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/betzy.html)).

One can check if the OpenMPI library is built with the GPU-aware support by running the following command: 
```console
$ ompi_info --parsable --all | grep mpi_built_with_cuda_support:value
```

The output of the command is either **value:true** or **value:false** as expressed below:

```console
mca:mpi:base:param:mpi_built_with_cuda_support:value:true
or
mca:mpi:base:param:mpi_built_with_cuda_support:value:false
```

The output message containing **value:true** means that the NVIDIA GPU-aware support in OpenMPI is enabled by default.

Here is an example of a batch script to launch a hybrid application on Saga and Betzy clusters.

```console

#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2G     #Host memory per CPU core

srun ./laplace.mpiacc
```

### On the supercomputer LUMI-EAP

We list below the modules to be loaded before compiling the application. We refer readers to the original documentation about the [supercomputer LUMI](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/) for further details about modules and the compilation process:

```console

```

Here we compile the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** applications on LUMI-EAP using a Cray compiler of the wrapper `ftn` as described in the following:

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenACC**

```console

The following batch script can be used to launch a hybrid application on LUMI-EAP.

```console
#!/bin/bash -l
#SBATCH --job-name=lap-mpiomp_eap
#SBATCH --account=project_xxxxx
#SBATCH --time=00:01:00
#SBATCH --partition=eap
#SBATCH --nodes=2            #Total nbr of nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=4  #Nbr of tasks per node
#SBATCH --gpus=8             #Total nbr of GPUs
#SBATCH --gpus-per-node=4    #Nbr of GPUs per node

##In the case a GPU-aware MPI is implemented
export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1

srun ./laplace.mpiomp
```
Note that the GPU-aware support in MPICH is enabled by setting the environment `export MPICH_GPU_SUPPORT_ENABLED=1` on Cray before running the hybrid application.

# Performance analysis on LUMI-G EAP

Our computational tests are performed on the supercomputer [LUMI-G EAP](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/eap/) (Early Access Platform) (4xAMD MI250x GPUs connected by the Infinity Fabric Link, see also the GPU specifications [here](https://www.amd.com/en/products/server-accelerators/instinct-mi250x)). We carry out experiments based on the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** APIs in the aim of illustrating the benefit of implementing the GPU-aware MPI library. 

We first begin with the effect of the GPU-aware MPI using the **MPI-OpenACC** API. This is shown in **Fig. 3**, in which the computations are performed on 4 Slurm GPUs. For reference, the computations based on a pure MPI is also shown (blue curve). Interesting enough, we can see clearly that the computing time is reduced by a factor of 10 when the GPU-aware support is enabled (black curve) compared to the case of the GPU-non-aware MPI (green curve). Moreover, the comparison with a pure MPI API shows a further increase of the performance by a factor of 30.

**Fig. 3.** *Comparison of the performance of the computations as a function of the number of points nx along the x-axis. Note that we use a unifore 2D-grid. The computations are carried out on a single node in which a total of 4 Slurm GPUs are allocated (i.e. 2xAMD MI250x GPUs on the [superocmputer LUMI](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/eap/)) using: (Black curve) **MPI-OpenACC** with the GPU-aware MPI support; (green curve) **MPI-OpenACC** with the GPU-non-aware MPI; (bleu curve) **MPI-alone** with 4 CPU-cores. The square symbols are used for guidance.* 
</div>

For completeness, we present in the table 1 a comparison of the performance between the hybrid **MPI-OpenACC** and **MPI-OpenMP** APIs. The performance is evaluated for both the GPU-aware MPI and the GPU-non-aware MPI and is shown for different sizes of the spatial grid. The comparison is summarised in the table below and shows a roughly similar performance between these two hybrid models. These results indicate, on one hand, the benefit of implementing the GPU-awareness approach independently on the GPU-directive model; and on the other hand, they highlight the similarity in the performance of the *MPI-OpenACC* and **MPI-OpenMP** APIs.

**MPI-OpenACC** with GPU-Non-aware MPI | 14.90 | 58.03 | 86.25 |
**MPI-OpenMP** with GPU-Non-aware MPI  | 14.84 | 61.21 | 85.58 |

# Conclusion

We have presented an overview on GPU-hybrid programming by integrating GPU-directive models (i.e. OpenACC and OpenMP APIs) with the MPI library. This was implemented via an application based on sloving the 2D-Laplace equation. The approach adopted here allows, in general, to utilise multiple GPU-devices not only within a single GPU node but it extends to multiple GPU partitions. It thus allows intra-process communications (i.e. GPU-to-CPU) and inter-process communications (i.e. GPU-to-GPU through GPU interconnects). In particular, we have addressed both GPU-non-aware MPI and GPU-aware MPI library approaches. The latter approach has the advantage of enabling a direct interaction between an MPI library and a GPU-device memory. In other words, it permits performing MPI operations between a pair of GPUs, thus reducing the computing time caused by the data locality. We have carried experiments on the [supercomputer LUMI-G Early Access Platform](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/eap/) and have observed an increase of the performance by a factor of 10 when implementing the GPU-aware MPI scheme and by almost a factor of 30 when it is compared to the case with MPI alone.

# Compilation process

In this section we summarise the compilation process of the source code **laplace_mpigpu.f90**. In this code, we use the preprocessor directive `#ifdef` (or also `#if defined`) to enable compiling the same code ported to multiple programming models. Here different options can be used to specify preprocessing of source files and that according to the used HPC system, as described below:

## On the cluster [Betzy](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/betzy.html)

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenACC**

```console
$ mpif90 -cpp -D_OPENACC -fast -acc -Minfo=accel -o laplace.mpiacc laplace_mpigpu.f90
```
````
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenMP**

```console
$ mpifort -cpp -D_OPENMP -mp=gpu -Minfo=mp -o laplace.mpiomp laplace_mpigpu.f90
```
````
`````

Where we use `-cpp` to manually invoke a preprocessor macro `_OPENACC` or `_OPENMP`.

## On the supercomputer [LUMI-EAP](https://docs.lumi-supercomputer.eu/eap/)

`````{tabs}
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenACC**

```console
$ ftn -eZ -D_OPENACC -hacc -o laplace.mpiacc laplace_mpigpu.f90
```
````
````{group-tab} **MPI-OpenMP**

```console
$ ftn -eZ -D_OPENMP -homp -o laplace.mpiomp laplace_mpigpu.f90
```
````
`````

As described in the previous section, we use the conditional compilation with the macros `_OPENACC` and `_OPENMP`. This is enabled in the Cray compiler by specifying the option `-eZ` followed by either `-D_OPENACC` to enable **OpenACC** directives or `-D_OPENMP` to enable **OpenMP** directives.
