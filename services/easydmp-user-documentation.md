## Select a template

EasyDMP is a web form consisting of a series of questions grouped into a number of sections.  The questionnaire is dynamic, meaning that the type and amount of questions you will be presented at every stage depends on the answer you have given at the previous stage.  For example, the Horizon 2020 template consists of up to 70 questions split into six sections. So the maximum amount of questions is 70, but most likely you will have much less than that. Many of the questions are designed as simple “yes/no” questions and each response results in pre-written text that will appear in your plan.

(Science-Europe-template)= 
### Science Europe template

Science Europe is an association of European Research Funding Organisations (RFO) and Research Performing Organisations (RPO), based in Brussels. Science Europe has recently published the [Practical Guide to the International Alignment of Research Data Management](https://www.scienceeurope.org/our-resources/practical-guide-to-the-international-alignment-of-research-data-management/), aiming to align the RDM requirements across research funding and research organisations in Europe. The guide is the results of a working group made by experts from Science Europe Member Organisations and in consultation with the broader research stakeholder community, including the Norwegian Research Council. The Science Europe guideline are recommended by the Norwegian Research Council. 

The template in easyDMP that implements the Science Europe guidelines is called *"Science Europe"*. {ref}`A practical guide <Science-Europe-template-Practical-Guide>`  complemented with a set of example is available to support the creation of  DMPs in compliance with Science Europe. The created DMP can be attached to the application for funding to several European funding agencies, including the Norwegian Research Council.

### EU Horizon 2020 template

We offer two different flavor of the Horizon 2020 template, namely a linear template, with a fixed amount of guidelines and instructions to fill up the required fields, and a dynamic one to guide your through the process of making the DMP by customizing every question on the basis of the previous answers.
