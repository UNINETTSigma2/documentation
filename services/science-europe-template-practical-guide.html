<p>The Science Europe guidelines consist of six core requirements - Data Collection, Data Quality, Data Storage, Ethical and Legal requirements, Data Sharing and Long Term Preservation, Data Management - translated into 13 questions. The present guide provides for each question (highlighted in italics) a high level description of the required information (in bullet and point), followed by the formulation of the question as it appears in easyDMP (in bold). Finally, one or more examples are provided to offer practical guidance for the formulation of the answer.</p>
<p>The structure is therefore the following:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Describe how you plan to collect new or use existing data.</strong> *</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The project will use data from three sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Experimental data produced by an X-ray crystallography on our sample materials. The data will be collected at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility (ESRF <a class="reference external" href="https://www.esrf.eu/">https://www.esrf.eu/</a>) and will be processed at the facility using the CCP4 (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/">https://www.ccp4.ac.uk/</a>) suite of software. Information on when the data was produced, and the conditions will be recorded in electronic notebooks at the ESRF. ASCII Log files will be produced by the CCP4 processing (the log files produced standardised output that is described in CCP4 documentation).</p></li>
<li><p>Simulation data on the molecular dynamics of the sample material. Simulation data does exist, but we need to produce more simulation samples to increase the statistical accuracy. For the existing simulations, information on how the data were produced is recorded in log files that are maintained on central servers at institution X (e.g. <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">https://example.org/institution/simulationData</span></code>) that are publicly accessible. Information on the additional simulation produced by this project will be stored in ASCII log files. The information in simulation log files follows the structure described in the documentation at institution X. The reused simulation data and the simulation data produced by this project will be publicly accessible at no cost. All simulations are produced with the GROMACS program (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.gromacs.org/">https://www.gromacs.org/</a>).</p></li>
<li><p>Images of the objects from which the samples were taken. The images will be taken with conventional digital photography. The images contain information on the location and date when they were taken. In addition, information on the conditions in which the photographs were taken will also be electronically recorded in an e-logbook.</p></li>

<ul class="simple">
<li><p>Give details on the kind of data: for example numeric (databases, spreadsheets), textual (documents), image, audio, video, and/or mixed media.</p></li>
<li><p>Give details on the data format: the way in which the data is encoded for storage, often reflected by the filename extension (for example pdf, xls, doc, txt, or rdf).</p></li>
<li><p>Justify the use of certain formats. For example, decisions may be based on staff expertise within the host organisation, a preference for open formats, standards accepted by data repositories, widespread usage within the research community, or on the software or equipment that will be used.</p></li>
<li><p>Give preference to open and standard formats as they facilitate sharing and long-term re-use of data (several repositories provide lists of such ‘preferred formats’).</p></li>
<li><p>Give details on the volumes (they can be expressed in storage space required (bytes), and/or in numbers of objects, files, rows, and columns).</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Questions:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Describe how much data, and the type of data you plan to collect or produce.</strong> *</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The project will create (approximately):</p>
<ul>
<li><p>100 GB of high-resolution images in the standard JPEG (<a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JPEG</a>) format. The JPEG format is chosen as a wide variety of software programs can read this format.</p></li>
<li><p>5 TB simulation data produced by the project will be stored in the GROMACS (GRO <a class="reference external" href="https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.3/online/gro.html">https://manual.gromacs.org/archive/5.0.3/online/gro.html</a>) format that is standard in the community and is open. In addition, we will use 2 TB of existing simulation data. So, a total of 7 TB simulation data.</p></li>
<li><p>10 TB of experimental data produced by the CCP4 program and stored in the standardised Crystallographic Information File (CIF <a class="reference external" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crystallographic_Information_File</a>) format that has an open license.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Describe how you will organise and document your data.</strong> *</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The experimental data will be arranged in directories according to sample, synchrotron beam run and processing run. Information will be recorded in a relational database at the project leader’s institution with access control that enables collaborators to access the information. The metadata schema will be extracted from the ESRF ICAT metadata catalogue and will follow the ICAT schema that is an agreed standard and contains all the information necessary to understand the data.</p></li>
<li><p>The simulation data will be stored in the central repository in institution X and will follow their layout.

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Describe how you will control the consistency and quality of your data.</strong> *</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>For the experimental data the quality of the data is recorded in the ESRF ICAT metadata catalogue and will be replicated to the project metadata catalogue. This metadata contains information on the position of the sample, the experimental station, beam conditions etc which is sufficient to understand the experimental data. The sample itself will be labelled and kept at the project leader’s institution for reference.</p></li>
<li><p>Simulation data quality will be recorded in log files and reference data will be produced during each simulation that will be compared with existing reference data to ensure simulations remain within tolerance. Information on the machines the simulations ran on and when is recorded in the log files which will be archived at institution X.</p></li>
<li><p>Digital photographs will be visually inspected on-site by project collaborators that have the right collect the images to ensure the images are of sufficient quality. A checklist of features will be drawn-up by experts in digital photography and each image will require approval by the WP leader responsible for acquiring the images.</p></li>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Describe how you will securely store and back up and recover your data during your project.</strong> *</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Example Response:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>The experimental data will initially be stored on the ESRF storage facility during data collection. The data will be subject to the ESRF storage and backup procedures (<a class="reference external" href="https://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MX/How_to_use_our_beamlines/Prepare_Your_Experiment/Backup">https://www.esrf.eu/UsersAndScience/Experiments/MX/How_to_use_our_beamlines/Prepare_Your_Experiment/Backup</a>) that project members will run in accordance with advice from ESRF.  The ESRF provides access control which the project will control. Once the experiment has completed data will be transferred to the Norwegian Infrastructure for Research Data (NIRD) project storage where data backup is provided by NIRD. NIRD provides storage with access control, only project collaborators will be provided access to the NIRD storage for the project. In the case of NIRD and ESRF project storage data being lost the backup procedures provide restore capabilities where lost data can be identified and recovered.</p></li>
<li><p>The simulation data will be produced on the Norwegian High-Performance Computing Facility (FRAM) which will store data on the NIRD project storage to which NIRD applies backup and recovery procedures. During the production data will be subject to access control restrictions to project collaborators. Once the simulation data are validated it will be transferred to the central storage at institution X which provides safe long-term storage for simulation data. Backup and recovery of NIRD storage is provided by NIRD and institution X will enforce the same backup and recovery procedures for the project’s data.</p></li>
<li><p>The images will be transferred from digital camera to the University of Oslo Sensitive Data facility (TSD) as the data contain information of a personal sensitive nature in accordance to Norwegian privacy regulation. Data will be backed-up according to TSD policies and only approved researchers will have access to the images. The project has been approved by the Regional Ethical committee (REK SØ 2019/1234).</p></li>
