(Olivia frequently asked questions)=

# Olivia frequently asked questions (FAQ):

## 1. I was a pilot during the test phase of Olivia, where can I find my project data from that period?
Any project that was active on Olivia during the pilot phase can now find its old project storage area in the following location:

```
Location: /cluster/old_pilot_data/nn**
```

If you wish to keep any data from your pilot project area, you must back it up to a different location before 1 January 2026.

**After 1 January 2026, all directories within /cluster/old_pilot_data/ will be permanently deleted.** This process is irreversible, and there will be no way to recover the data, without exceptions.

We strongly advise you to set a reminder in your calendar to back up this data in due time before the deadline.
