# Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services

The Norwegian research infrastructure services (NRIS) is a collaboration
between Sigma2 and the universities of Bergen (UiB), Oslo (UiO), Tromsø (UiT
The Arctic University of Norway) and NTNU, to provide national supercomputing
and data storage services. These services are operated by NRIS and coordinated
and managed by Sigma2.

NRIS provides valuable resources for the research communities: state of the art
{ref}`compute <hardware-overview>` and {ref}`storage facilities <nird>`, backed
by {ref}`support <support-line>` and a guarantee that your data always stays in
Norway. Possibly more important is easy access to a {ref}`wide selection of
competences <extended-support>` that can assist, realize or take your project
to the next level. {ref}`Read more ... <about-us>`

**Compute resources**:
{ref}`Overview <hardware-overview>` | {ref}`betzy` | {ref}`olivia` | {ref}`saga` | {ref}`lumi`


**Storage resources**:
{ref}`nird` | {ref}`storage-areas`

**Data & Storage Services**:
{ref}`nird-dp` | {ref}`nird-dl` | {ref}`backup service` | {ref}`nird-cdl` | {ref}`research-data-archive` |  {ref}`nird-service-platform`

**Tools and other services**:
{ref}`nird-toolkit` | {ref}`Course resources <course-resources>`

**NRIS Videos**: [NRIS YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCG6fTXEY_SQYohtpU6aZwPw) | {ref}`training-videos` | {ref}`short-videos`
