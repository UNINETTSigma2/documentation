# Extended User Support (3-4 weeks of work)

For smaller adoptions, optimisations, and changes which are exceeding ordinary
support, you can **ask support staff for extended user support**.

Extended user support can also be initiated by the
support staff, typically if they see that this could be of a relevance, e.g.
in connection with ineffective jobs. In this case you will be contacted by the
support staff and offered the extended user support.

Extended user support projects are not requiring any funding or in-kind from
the project or user. The total amount of work effort must not exceed 70-80
hours over maximum 3-4 weeks (i.e. it should be smaller than 1 person month;
above that, advanced user support kicks in which requires a more thorough pre-
and post-review).

A likely outcome is that extended user support could lead to formulation of an
[advanced user support](https://www.sigma2.no/advanced-user-support), which
needs an application and evaluation, but in turn could assign a few months of
dedicated work from one of our experts.
