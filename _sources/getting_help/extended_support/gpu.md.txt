# GPU Support
GPU (**G**raphics **P**rocessing **U**nit) are accelerators that can be
efficiently utilized in HPC to speed-up calculations that deal with lots of
data. GPUs have successfully been used to speed-up applications such as machine
learning, weather forecasting, molecular dynamics, among many other
applications.

At NRIS we have a dedicated team to support researchers in utilizing the
different accelerators at your disposal. You can contact the team through the
{ref}`normal support channel <support-line>`.

Example of activities that NRIS supports:
- Helping to use Slurm and GPUs
- Ensure software is set up for GPUs
- Advice about how to get starting using GPUs
- Transition to using GPUs
- Optimizing existing GPU implementations
  - With a focus on software developed at the universities in Norway
- Training
  - Both from NRIS and in collaboration with vendors
- Documentation and [tutorials](code_development).
