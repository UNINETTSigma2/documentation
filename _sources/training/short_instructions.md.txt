## Parallel Computing

[In this video playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLoR6m-sar9AibHwGSFUZQ9QNxa5dSLl7O), we will cover parallel computing on Linux clusters. Parallel computing involves performing multiple calculations or processes at the same time to break down a large task into smaller, manageable sub-tasks. This approach typically boosts performance and efficiency.

We will start by using Fortran for parallel computing to perform matrix multiplication. Fortran is one of the oldest programming languages still widely used today, especially in high-performance computing. As we continue with these videos, we will also explore parallel computing using Python and C.

In these videos, we emphasize the use of Python scripts. While creating these scripts takes time, they can be reused, enhancing efficiency and serving as useful documentation of your processes. Initially, typing Linux commands directly might seem quicker, but using scripts becomes a time-saver as you advance. Regularly entering the same Linux commands without scripts is inefficient.

In these videos, we will be using the Emacs editor, but please feel free to use any editor that you are comfortable with. We hope these videos will enhance your parallel computing skills. Enjoy your computing journey!

If anything was unclear or you think something should have been explained in more detail, please let us know in the video comments on Youtube. We appreciate your feedback and it will help us improving these videos.

To use the scripts and files from the videos as templates for your work, copy them from this folder on the Saga Linux Cluster: /cluster/work/support/ParallelComputingYoutube
