# HPC On-boarding 18-20 April 2023

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for new users of HPC systems. 

The course is highly recommended  for all new users of national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and all interested in the feild.

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those who
have little experience with UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or who have never
worked on the command line of a terminal, we will offer a hands-on pre-course about UNIX 
a day before the HPC course.

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**


## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom) and 
to access the HPC systems (eg: ssh).

You can always contact us by sending an email to [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no).

If you want to receive further information about training events, and other announcements 
about IT resources and services for researchers, there are a couple of information channels
 you can subscribe to:
- users at University of Bergen and affiliated institutes: [register to hpcnews@uib.no](https://mailman.uib.no/listinfo/hpcnews)
- users of Sigma2 services: [subscribe to Sigma2's newsletter](https://sigma2.us13.list-manage.com/subscribe?u=4fd109ad79a5dca6dde7e4997&id=59b164c7b6)

## **Registration**

The course is free of charge and is organised by the NRIS partners UiB, UiO, UiT, NTNU & Sigma2.
Ordinary registration closes on **14th April** so that we get enough time to ensure that everyone
 has an account on the HPC systems  in case a participant does not already have one. 
Registration is [here](https://skjemaker.app.uib.no/view.php?id=14145416).

## Course material

Course material will be mostly based on [Unix for HPC](https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/unix-for-hpc/index.html) and  [HPC-Intro](https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/hpc-intro/index.html) 

## Code of Conduct

All participants in our course are expected to show respect and courtesy to
others. We follow [carpentry code of conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-detailed-view).
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you either report to 
the zoom host right away or write to [the training team](mailto:training@nris.no).

## Preparing your machine for the course

We assume you have the necessary tools installed on your machine and are able
to use them. You need tools to login into a remote machine. 
If you are using Windows 10 or earlier versions and you don’t have a terminal to execute UNIX
commands, you are requested to install [Git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org/).
If you need help , please join us the login help session on 17th April at 13:00-14:00 using the same zoom link you receved via email.
