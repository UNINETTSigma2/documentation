# Best Practices on Clusters Spring Series 2024

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering
a best practices course for users of national infrastructure services.

The workshop is organised as a series of monthly events starts on 8th February 
and ends on 23  May. During these monthly training, each topic  will focus on different 
aspects related to the everyday usage of HPC/Storage  facilities in order to facilitate
a valuable and productive framework to develop your research. See the schedule part for detailed information on the topics.   

**The course is open to all and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to upskill  their knowledge of the usage of HPC fnd storage facilities. 
This is a follow-up course to the {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2023-autumn-onboarding>` course
(although it is not a prerequisite, but we expect the participants to have basic HPC knowledge).
