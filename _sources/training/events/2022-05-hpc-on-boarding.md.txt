# HPC On-boarding May 2022

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for current and future users of national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy). 

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those who
have little experience with UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or who have never
worked on the command line of a terminal, we will offer a hands-on pre-course about UNIX 
a day before the HPC course.

**The course is open to all users and free of charge.**

```{note}
  **The video recordings and notes can be found [here](https://documentation.sigma2.no/training/material.html)**

```

## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom,
might work from a browser), to access the HPC systems (e.g., ssh or Putty), to
transfer data to/from an HPC system (e.g., scp or WinSCP).

You can always contact us by sending an email to [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no).

If you want to receive further information about training events, and other announcements about IT resources and services for researchers, there are a couple of information channels you can subscribe to:

## **Registration**

The course is free of charge and is organised by the NRIS partners UiB, UiO, UiT, NTNU & Sigma2. Registration closes on **25th April** for those attending LINUX course and HPC course. We need a bit time to ensure that everyone has an account on the HPC systems in case a participant does not already have one.
**Registration is closed**.

## Course material

Course material will be mostly based on the [HPC-Intro](https://training.pages.sigma2.no/tutorials/hpc-intro/index.html) 

## Code of Conduct

All participants in our course are expected to show respect and courtesy to
others. We follow [carpentry code of
conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html#code-of-conduct-detailed-view).
If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report
it to [the training team](mailto:training@nris.no).

## Preparing your machine for the course

We assume you have the necessary tools installed on your machine and are able
to use them. You need tools to login into a remote machine (e.g., ssh or PuTTY)
and to transfer data to/from a remote machine (e.g., scp or WinSCP). If you
need to install such tools, please see [prepare your machine
section](https://wiki.uib.no/hpcdoc/index.php/HPC_and_NIRD_toolkit_course_fall_2020#Preparing_your_machine_for_the_course).
