# Modern Fortran Workshop Series Spring 2023

NRIS (Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services) is organizing a workshop series
 on modern FORTRAN. The workshops teach newest Fortran standards. The hands-on 
workshop will aimed at those who want to write modern code in FORTRAN, or to
 modernize existing codes, or to combine Fortran code with  Python and C by 
focussing on four different topics on each day.  
The workshop is organised as four different  events starts on 9th March and
 ends on 25th May.

**The course is open to all users and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

## **Practical Information**

- This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity.

 If the participant don't have access to national resources yet
 we will send you information via email after registration on how to get access.

```{note}
It is not mandatory to have account on national HPCs to attend the course.
 Participants can follow the lectures without having an account on national
