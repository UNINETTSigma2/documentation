# Best Practices on NRIS Clusters May 2022

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering
a course for users of national HPC systems (Saga, Fram, Betzy). 
The two half days course is the follow up to the {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2022-spring-onboarding>`
course. We will focus on different aspects related to the everyday usage
of HPC facilities in order to facilitate an valuable and productive framework
to develop your research. These include best practices and trouble shooting,
resource management, software installation, gpu computing with slurm and advanced 
user support. 

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to deepen their knowledge of the usage of HPC facilities. This is a follow-up
course to the {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2022-spring-onboarding>` course (although it is not a prerequisite). 
If you are new to HPC, we highly recommend to refer the course material of {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding course<training-2022-spring-onboarding>` to benefit from this course.

**The course is open to all users and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**
