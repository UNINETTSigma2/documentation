# NRIS Best Practices Course 9-11 May 2023

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering
a best practices course for users of national HPC systems (Saga, Fram, Betzy) 
and all interested in the feild.

The three half days course is the follow up to the
{ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2023-spring-onboarding>`
course. We will focus on different aspects related to the everyday usage
of HPC facilities in order to facilitate an valuable and productive framework
to develop your research. These include NRIS HPC systems overview, best practices
and trouble shooting,resource management, software installation, GPUs etc.

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to upskill  their knowledge of the usage of HPC facilities. This is a follow-up
course to the {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2023-spring-onboarding>` course
(although it is not a prerequisite).

**The course is open to all users and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

## **Practical Information**

- This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity.

- To do the hands-on exercises on NRIS HPCs, the participants need an account 
on national HPC. If the participant don't have acces to national resources yet
 we will send you information via email after registration on how to get access.

```{note}
It is not mandatory to have account on national HPCs to attend the course.
 Participants can follow the lectures without having an account on national
 resources since the course content is applicable to all HPCs
```
