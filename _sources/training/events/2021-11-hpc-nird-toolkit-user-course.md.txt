# HPC and NIRD toolkit user course November 2021

In November 2021, the Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services **NRIS**
(formerly known as the Metacenter) partners Sigma2, UiB, UiO & UiT  are jointly
offering a hands-on course for current and future users of national HPC systems
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and the NIRD Toolkit. The course is open to all users and
free of charge.

For individual sessions we list recommended prerequisites. The participants can
choose which session they want to attend and you're certainly welcome to just
attend all sessions you are interested in. On each course day, we will start at
09:00 and conclude at around 13:00. Each "morning" will include presentations
and hands-on time on one of the actual HPC systems or the NIRD Toolkit. We
recommend that participants use the afternoon on each day to repeat examples
from the morning to get more experience on the systems.

  **The video recordings and notes can be found [here](https://documentation.sigma2.no/training/material.html)**

```
## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom,
might work from a browser), to access the HPC systems (e.g., ssh or Putty), to
transfer data to/from an HPC system (e.g., scp or WinSCP) and to access the
NIRD Toolkit (web browser).

```{note}

1. Those who do not have an account on one of the HPC machines or NIRD
   (storage, Toolkit, ...) yet need to apply for an account. The application
   page is available
   [here](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/notur/) and
   documentation for the application procedure is available
   [here](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account). You are applying for
   an HPC account. For the project, please select “NN9987K: Course Resources as
   a Service #3” (the Project manager will be filled in automatically), choose
   Saga under Resources, set the Account start date to 2021-10-26 and the
   Account end date to one week after the course, that is 2021-11-12.

2. In order to use the NIRD Toolkit during the course you will need either a
   Feide account or a Feide OpenIDP guest account.  You can create a Feide
   OpenIDP guest account at https://openidp.feide.no/.  See your
   eduPersonPrincipalName (eduPPN) at http://innsyn.feide.no . Those who  are 
   using Feide openidp guest account should go to minside.dataporten.no to find    eduppn, and it is the field called "Secondary user identifiers".

## Preparing your machine for the course

We assume you have the necessary tools installed on your machine and are able
to use them. You need tools to login into a remote machine (e.g., ssh or PuTTY)
and to transfer data to/from a remote machine (e.g., scp or WinSCP). If you
need to install such tools, please see [prepare your machine
section](https://wiki.uib.no/hpcdoc/index.php/HPC_and_NIRD_toolkit_course_fall_2020#Preparing_your_machine_for_the_course).
