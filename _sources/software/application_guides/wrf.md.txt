## Building from source

There are a lot of issues when building WRF from source, but most is covered in the WRF documentation. 
Below are some hints that apply locally.

Please make sure all modules are using the same toolchain, like `intel/2021a` etc. 

When building WRF from source and using Intel compiler some small changes are needed in the `arch/configure.defaults` file. In the section for *Intel icc/ifort* the lines specifying mpiwrappers should read :
- `DM_FC = mpiifort`
- `DM_CC = mpiicc`
This is suggested in the section header. 

In addition when building on Betzy with AMD processors the `-xAVX` does not work if the main routine is built using this setting. Experience have shown that changing the  default flag on file arch/configure.defaults by modifying the line `OPTAVX = -xAVX` to `OPTAVX = -arch=core-avx2` yield the same performance.
