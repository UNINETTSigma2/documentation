# GaussView

Gaussview is a visualization program that can be used to open Gaussian output files and checkpoint files (.chk) to display structures, molecular orbitals, normal modes, etc. You can also set up jobs and submit them directly.

## License and access
The license for Gaussian is commercial/proprietary and currently only UiT holds a site license. Thus GaussView on Sigma2 machines is available for UiT users only, unless a user or a group holds an invividual license to the code.
