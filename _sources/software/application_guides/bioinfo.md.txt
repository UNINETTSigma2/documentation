# Bioinformatics Software & Databases

## Bioinformatics Databases
To save your storage quota and to unload our file system a bit, we offer some
bioinformatics databases in an openly readable folder on Saga.  We try to keep
them updated, but if you find them to be outdated, please write us at
support@nris.no

All of databases for the following programs can be found on Saga under
`/cluster/shared/databases/`.

- Bowtie2: database coming shortly
- EMBL database excluding human & environmental records
- NCBI taxonomy database
- ecoPCR database reformatted for the ecotag step of [OBITools
  pipeline](bioinfo/obitools.md)
- UniProt complete database
