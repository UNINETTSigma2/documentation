# What is the NIRD Toolkit ?
Say you want to install an application and make it
accessible to the outside world. To do this, you most likely need to have
some knowledge of the computer (such as the OS, hardware specs, network rules etc.)
you will be installing it on, as well as some application specific
knowledge.

Often, the installation process is error-prone and takes a lot of
time. The NIRD Toolkit  attempts to automate this by providing a set of
pre-configured application templates (in the NIRD Toolkit  world this is
known as a package), making it possible to install an
application instantly without much configuration.

Each application created through the NIRD Toolkit  provides a user accessible web
interface, as well as the ability to limit access using services similar to
Dataporten.

The NIRD Toolkit is a Kubernetes based cloud infrastructure, just alike Google, Azure or Amazon kubernetes Clouds. The software runs into containers to ensure high portability of the tools and reproducibility of the results. It is highly customizable, meaning you can have the tools you want with the version you want.

The NIRD toolkit allows pre/post processing analysis, data intensive processing, visualization, artificial intelligence and machine learning platform.

To install your first package, go to the [Installing a package](package-install.md) section.
