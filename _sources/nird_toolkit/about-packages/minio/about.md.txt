# Configuration
## Setting a more secure password
In order to set up a more secure password and username, go to the
`Configuration` section, and enter a more random `Root user` and
`Root password`. Keep in mind that these will be stored in plain-text and be
accessible in the application `Configuration` tab, so don't reuse these
anywhere.
The `Root user` and `Root password` you entered can then be used when login into
minio.

# Usage
## Uploading files
Begin by creating a new bucket by clicking on the `Create bucket` plus sign in
the right-hand corner.
