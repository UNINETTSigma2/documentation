# Security policy for Sigma2 infrastructure


## Privileges

- Users shall not be able to escalate their privilege by any means. Any patch
  or mechanism to accomplish this shall be rolled out without undue delay.


## Data access and file permissions

- Users data are personal and private
- Users shall not be able to access other users home directories or scratch areas
- Project data is private to the project and is controlled by the project lead
- The PL has sole discretion over access to the project, and thus to its project area.


## Network access for users

- Users shall enter the system via approved login nodes
- Compute nodes shall not have direct access to the public internet
- In cases where compute nodes need internet access, e.g. license servers, this is to be documented and traceable
