# Access and login


## Getting access

To gain access to the storage services, a formal application is required. The
process is explained at the
[How to apply for a user account](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account)
page.

Users must be registered and authorised by the project responsible
before getting access.

To access or transfer data, we recommend to use `ssh` or
`rsync`. More details on our page about {ref}`file-transfer`.

The NIRD can be accessed via the following address

```console
login.nird.sigma2.no
```

You will be logged into your home area `/nird/home/$USERHOME`


## Software access

Software can be accessed as module just like on HPCs. Please see the {ref}`module-scheme` for details.

```{warning}
Module command is not yet stable. Please report any issue encountered to support line, 
contact **[support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no)**.

```
In addition a number of software can be accessed via command line.
