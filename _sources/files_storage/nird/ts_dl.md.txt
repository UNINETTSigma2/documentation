# NIRD Data Peak vs NIRD Data Lake

NIRD consists of two distinct storage systems, namely NIRD Data Peak (known internally as TS) and NIRD Data Lake (codenamed DL).

NIRD Data Peak has several tiers spanned by single filesystem and designed for performance and used mainly for active project data.

NIRD Data Lake has a flat structure, designed mainly for less active data, sharing data across multiple projects, and interfacing with external storages.

Both are based on IBM Elastic Storage System.
