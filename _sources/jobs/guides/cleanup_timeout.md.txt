# How to recover files before a job times out

Possibly you would like to clean up the work directory or recover
files for restart in case a job times out.  This is perhaps most
useful when using the `$SCRATCH` work directory (see {ref}`storage-areas`).

In this example we ask Slurm to send a signal to our script 120
seconds before it times out to give us a chance to perform clean-up
actions.

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: files/timeout_cleanup.sh
  :language: bash
```

Download the script:
```{eval-rst}
:download:`files/timeout_cleanup.sh`
```

Also note that jobs which use `$SCRATCH` as the work directory can use
the `savefile` and `cleanup` commands to copy files back to the submit
directory before the work directory is deleted (see info about {ref}`job-work-directory`).
