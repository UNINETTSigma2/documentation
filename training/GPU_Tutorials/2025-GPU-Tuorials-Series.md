# Hands-On Workshop: Fine-Tuning LLMs with Multi-GPU Training <time datetime="2025-11-05 20:00"> 05 Nov. 2025 </time>
## *NRIS* GPU Tutorials Series 

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering a series of GPU Tutorial events given every now and then on relevant topics in the area of GPU utilization, Machine Learning, Large Language models and related topics. 

**The course is open to all and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to upskill their knowledge on GPU utilization and usage. 

## Practical Information

- This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity.

```{note}
Access to necessary GPU resources will be provided by the course organizers, but access is based upon request. Please thoroughly read information given for each individual events and follow the instructions for necessary registrations given there.

```

## Events and Schedule

All times are given in CET/CEST depending on date.

### Hands-On Workshop: Fine-Tuning LLMs with Multi-GPU Training on an HPC System

**Date & Time**: 05 Nov. 2025, 09:30 - 15:30 <br>
**Location**: Online <br>
**Instructor**: [Hicham Agueny](https://www4.uib.no/en/find-employees/Hicham.Agueny)
<br>
<br> 
**Content:**
Gain practical experience in fine-tuning Large Language Models (LLMs) with the LLaMA architecture and LoRA on the [Olivia supercomputer](https://www.sigma2.no/meet-olivia-norways-next-supercomputer). The workshop combines fine-tuning concepts with practical and HPC-specific execution.

<u>You will learn to:</u>

By the end of this workshop, participants will be able to:

- Apply LoRA fine-tuning to LLaMA models.
- Configure and run distributed training jobs on multiple GPUs.
- Perform inference tasks such as QA and summarization.
- Monitor GPU usage and memory utilization.

This workshop is ideal for researchers, developers, and students with Python experience who want hands-on skills in scalable LLM training.

**Registration**: [HERE](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeQ00Qgwc47Qlzxiw2Q924YSIqHXWuKEhzy5tWrhdHwbwpw8Q/viewform) (**Registration deadline Oct. 28th!**)

**IMPORTANT**

We do have a *login-check* session **Tuesday November 4th at 10:30-12:00** which is mandatory for all participants that wants to log in and attend the practical part of the course.
