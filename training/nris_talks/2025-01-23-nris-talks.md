# NRIS Talks : Webinar on Introduction to VASP and how to run VASP calculation on NRIS Clusters

NRIS(Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services) is organising  webinars as part of it's outreach program **NRIS Talks**.
This time, we will explore how to effectively utilize the Vienna Ab-initio Simulation Package (VASP) on supercomputers. This webinar is primarily designed for beginners and intermediate users at various levels, with an emphasis on best practices for conducting VASP calculations on NRIS clusters. This webinar content is based on the VASP best practices workshop materials developed by ENCCS and NSC. 

## Webinar Details

- **Date:** 23rd January 2025
- **Time:** 13:00 - 14:00

##  About the webinar

The webinar will cover:

- General introduction to VASP, essential files and parameters, workflow
- Running VASP on HPCs
- Demo on NRIS Cluster Saga
- Q&A
- Webiinar content is based on the [lesson material](https://enccs.github.io/vasp-best-practices/) developed by and NSC and ENCCS.
## Who Should Attend

This workshop is mostly suitable for beginners and intermediate users of VASP at different stages. It is useful but not necessary to have basic knowledge of electronic structure theory and/or DFT.

## Acknowledgement 

We thank the ENCCS and NSC for the [VASP best practices workshop material](https://enccs.github.io/vasp-best-practices/) and agreeing to reuse it for this webinar.
