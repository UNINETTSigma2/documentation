# HPC On-boarding 05-08 May 2025

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for new users of HPC systems. 

The course is highly recommended  for all new users of national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and all interested in the field.
**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those who
have little experience with UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or who have never
worked on the command line of a terminal, the first day of the course is dedicated for you. 

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**
