**<p style="font-size: 32px;">Best Practices for High Performance Computing**

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (NRIS) is offering a best practices and tools hands-on course for users of the national infrastructure services.

The workshop is organised as a series of events  - normally within one semester. During these events, each topic will focus on different aspects related to the everyday usage of high-performance computing (HPC) clusters and/or storage facilities in order to facilitate a valuable and productive framework to develop your research. 

**The course is open to all and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to upskill  their knowledge of the usage of HPC and storage facilities. 
This is a follow-up course to the {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2025-autumn-onboarding>` course (although it is not a prerequisite, we expect the participants to have basic HPC knowledge). Being familiar with basic tools used with HPC and remote computing is fundamental for this course. We assume familiarity with the Linux command line. If you need to brush up on your skills, you can for instance watch a recording of our last HPC onboarding training [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkX6dqpwrog).

Below you find the list of episodes and how to register. Episodes are self-contained, you can join only for the episodes you find useful.

# How to parallelize independent tasks on HPC: 04/03/2026 (09:00-12:00 CET)

**Content:** Sometimes you need to run many similar calculations. Instead of running them one after the other and managing many job scripts
or writing elaborate shell scripts, we will learn how to run them potentially at the same time using a workflow manager without writing many job scripts.
We will demonstrate and practice this using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/). If your calculation is a for-loop in Python or R and it takes too long to run, this session is for you.

## **Practical Information**

- This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity.

```{note}
It is not mandatory to have an account on national HPC clusters to attend the course.
 Participants can follow the lectures and demos without having an account on national
 resources since the course content is applicable to all HPC systems. **If you are an existing user,
kindly provide your username while registering.** You will get access to the training project. 
If you wish to set up a user account, you can apply for one. The application page is available [here](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/hpc/) and and documentation for
 the application procedure is available [here](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account).
 When applying for an account, please select **NN9970K**: Training and Outreach as the project,
 choose Saga under Resources, set the account start date as the date of application, and set the account end date
 to 2026-05-30.
