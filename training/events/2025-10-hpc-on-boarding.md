# HPC On-boarding October 14-16 2025

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for new users of high performance computing (HPC) systems. 

The course is highly recommended  for all new users of the national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and all interested in the field.
**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those with 
little experience using UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or working on the command 
line of a terminal, the first day of the course is designed specifically for you. 

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**

## Registration

The course is organised by NRIS, registration deadline is October 9th 2025. **REGISTER: Registration to be opened soon**

## Practical Information

This is an online course via Zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (Zoom) and 
to access the HPC systems (eg: ssh).
