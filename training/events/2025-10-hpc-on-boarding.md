# HPC On-boarding <time datetime="2025-10-14 20:00"> 14-16 October 2025 </time>

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for new users of high performance computing (HPC) systems. 

The course is highly recommended  for all new users of the national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and all interested in the field.
**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what HPC is or how to use it. For those with 
little experience using UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or working on the command 
line of a terminal, the first day of the course is designed specifically for you. 

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**

**User Account and connection verification**: For all course participants, we want to make sure that you are able to log in an follow the practical parts of the course - thus we organise a login help session on October 13th 09:00-10:00. Note that this is compulsory in the sense that if you later experience access challenges, you are low on priority list. Link to this part is same as link to the course zoom event.
