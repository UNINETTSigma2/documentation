# HPC On-boarding 3-5 October 2023

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering 
an on-boarding hands-on course for new users of HPC systems. 

The course is highly recommended  for all new users of national HPC systems 
(Saga, Fram, Betzy) and all interested in the feild.

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees of any
background. We assume no prior knowledge of what an HPC is or how to use it. For those who
have little experience with UNIX-like operating systems such as Linux or who have never
worked on the command line of a terminal, we will offer a hands-on pre-course about UNIX 
a day before the HPC course.

**The course is open to all and free of charge.**


## **Practical Information**

This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and
pre-installed programs to participate in the video meeting of the course (zoom) and 
to access the HPC systems (eg: ssh).

You can always contact us by sending an email to [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no).
