# Introduction to FORTRAN 

NRIS (Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services) is organizing a workshop series on **Introduction to FORTRAN**. Fortran is a programming langiuage that has been designed for scientific computing. 
On this course, you will learn: 
- Introduction to the language, Formula Translator. Numerical calculation
- Data types - importance of sizes and ranges
- Syntax of the language
- File I/O: formatting, handling arrays
- Modules and interfaces, class objects
- Performance aspects and parallel computing 
- Best practices for writing efficient FORTRAN applications

The workshop is organised as a series of five events starts on 18th October and
ends on 13th December.

*The course is open to all and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

You can always contact us by sending an email to [support@nris.no](mailto:support@nris.no).

## Prerequisites

- Familiarity with Linux and Linux editors is recommended.
- Basics/principles of programming (in any language) is desirable.
- This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity.
- Install Fortran on your laptop or home computer, it's available for most architectures and operating systems. Please see the [install help link](https://fortran-lang.org/learn/os_setup/install_gfortran/) for further details. All examples will run on your laptop. 
**Note**: If the participants need an account on national HPC, you can specify it in the registration form and we will contact you with application procedure.
