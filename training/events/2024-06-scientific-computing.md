# Scientific Computing Workshop (11-12 June)

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (**NRIS**) is offering
a scientific computing workshop, two half days event focusing on two 
different topics.
1. Using NetCDF data format with Modern Fortran 

Unidata [Network Common Data Form (NetCDF)](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/software/netcdf/) is a set of libraries and 
machine-independent data formats that support the creation, access, and 
sharing of array-oriented scientific data. The workshop will focus on netCDF 
file structure, compiliing and linkiing and how to read and write netCDF files
 with modern Fortran

2. Profiling and optimising software applications on HPC 

Running scientific application in order to maximise the efficiency of the 
hardware is increasingly important as the core count increase. There are 
several steps with increasing complexity that can be taken to learn more about
 the applicationâ€™s behaviour.

**The course is open to all and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students and researchers who want
 to upskill  their knowledge on the specific topics.

**Prerequisites**: For better learning experience, participants are expected to have basic 
programmiing knowledge on C/Fortran for day 1 and basic HPC knowledge for day2.
