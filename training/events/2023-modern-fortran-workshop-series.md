# Modern Fortran Workshop Series Spring 2023

NRIS (Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services) is organizing a workshop series
 on modern FORTRAN. The workshops teach newest Fortran standards. The hands-on 
workshop will aimed at those who want to write modern code in FORTRAN, or to
 modernize existing codes, or to combine Fortran code with  Python and C by 
focussing on four different topics on each day.  
The workshop is organised as four different  events starts on 9th March and
 ends on 25th May.

**The course is open to all users and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**
