# Best Practices and Tools for High Performance Computing 

The Norwegian Research Infrastructure Services (NRIS) is offering a best practices and tools course for users of national infrastructure services.

The workshop is organised as a series of monthly events during the spring semester 2025. During these monthly training, each topic will focus on different aspects related to the everyday usage of HPC/Storage facilities in order to facilitate a valuable and productive framework to develop your research. 

**The course is open to all and free of charge, but registration is mandatory.**

**Targeted Audience**: The course is aimed at students, researchers and employees
who want to upskill  their knowledge of the usage of HPC and storage facilities. 
This is a follow-up course to the {ref}`NRIS HPC on-boarding<training-2024-autumn-onboarding>` course
(although it is not a prerequisite, but we expect the participants to have basic HPC knowledge). Being 
familiar with basics tools used with HPC and remote computing is fundamental for this course. 
Familiarize yourself with the Linux command line. You can watch our past HPC onboarding training [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YkX6dqpwrog).

Here below you find the list of episodes and how to register. Episodes are self-contained, you can join only for the episodes that are useful for your research.

## Episode 1: 21/01/2025 (10:00-12:00 CET)- How to parallelize independence tasks on HPC

**Content:** Sometimes you need to run many similar calculations. Instead of running them one after the other and managing many job scripts
or writing elaborate shell scripts, we will learn how to run them potentially at the same time using a workflow manager without writing many job scripts.
We will demonstrate and practice this using [Snakemake](https://snakemake.github.io/). If your calculation is a for-loop in Python or R and it takes too long to run, this session is for you.

- Radovan Bast

## Episode 2: 11/02/2025 (10:00-12:00 CET)- Advanced shell scripting and utilities

**Content:** The focus will be on advance shell scripting, shell best practices and utilities like sed & awk to streamline
operations and ensuring efficiency.

```{note}
It is not mandatory to have account on national HPCs to attend the course.
 Participants can follow the lectures and demos without having an account on national
 resources since the course content is applicable to all HPCs. **If you are an existing user,
kindly provide your username while registering.** You will get access to the training project. 
If you wish to set up user account, you can apply for one. The application page is available [here](https://www.metacenter.no/user/application/form/hpc/) and and documentation for
 the application procedure is available [here](https://www.sigma2.no/how-apply-user-account).
 You are applying for an HPC account. For the project, please select **NN9970K**: Training and Outreach,
