# NumPy and Pandas fundamentals for handling biological datasets (27-28 May 2025)


This course is delivered by University of Oslo in collaboration with BioNT,
Norwegian Ai Cloud and Coderefinery. All NRIS users are welcome to join this.


BioNT - BIO Network for Training - is an international consortium of academic 
entities and small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). BioNT is dedicated to
providing a comprehensive training program and fostering a community for
digital skills relevant to the biotechnology industry and biomedical sector.
 With a curriculum tailored for both beginners and advanced professionals, 
BioNT aims to equip individuals with the necessary expertise in handling, 
processing, and visualising biological data, as well as utilising computational
biology tools. Leveraging the consortium's strong background in digital literacy
training and extensive network of collaborations, BioNT is poised to professionalise
life sciences data management, processing, and analysis skills.

This intensive workshop focuses on applying machine learning techniques to biological
and genomic data, combining theoretical foundations with hands-on coding experience.
 Participants will work through real-world scenarios using Python-based tools and 
frameworks that are critical for modern bioinformatics.

## Module 1  

- Prerequisite: Basic knowledge in Python and should know how to create virtual environments

provides a solid foundation in scientific computing with Python. Across two half-day 
sessions, participants will explore essential data handling techniques using NumPy
 and Pandasâ€”tools widely adopted for manipulating and analyzing biological data. 


## **How to join**

- No registration required for module 1
- This is an online course via zoom. Participants require access to a computer
(not provided by the course organisers) with internet connectivity and Python3 installed.
