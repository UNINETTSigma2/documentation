## *NAIC* - Beyond the mainstream - hands-on series

The main goal of this course is to expose participants to alternative 
technologies beyond the dominant, widely used solutions. 
That has several benefits:

 - Reduces vendor lock‑in and increases our negotiating power, 
   helping us get better value for every krone spent.
 - Strengthens digital sovereignty: relying on a single foreign
   provider creates operational and political vulnerabilities 
   that could disrupt Norwegian users’ ability to work.
 - Encourages the growth of alternative technologies by giving
   users low‑risk opportunities to evaluate them before committing.
 - Accounts for additional adoption factors introduced by AI, 
   such as electricity consumption per token, not just metrics 
   like GPU memory or core count.

```

Norwegian Ai Cloud [www.naic.no](http://www.naic.no) in collaboration with NRIS,
organizes a series of courses for the Norwegian users to try out new 
technology risk and cost free (**try-and-buy**). If the users would like do more, 
we would help you with that and also help you get access to the hardware.
