# LINPACK benchmark {#linpack-benchmark}

The [LINPACK benchmark](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/), used by
the [TOP500 HPC list](https://www.top500.org/), solves a dense
system of linear equations and is used to measure the _floating-point
capabilities_ of CPUs.

The [LINPACK sourcecode](https://www.netlib.org/benchmark/hpl/) is
compiled using the Intel `icc` compiler as follows:

```
$ module load intel/2018b
$ cd hpl-2.3
$ ./configure CC=mpicc CXX=mpicxx --prefix=/cluster/projects/nn9999k/marcink/hpl LDFLAGS=-lm
$ make
```

To run, the benchmark requires a configuration file
({download}`inputs/HPL.dat`) to reside in the same directory as the
`xhpl` binary. We run the benchmark on 32 cores of a
single compute node (all communication can be done through shared memory):

```
$ mpirun -np 32 ./xhpl
[...]
T/V                N    NB     P     Q               Time                 Gflops
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WR11C2R4       50000   192     4     8              86.82             9.5985e+02
[...]
```

The program reports computing at 960 GFLOP/s. Looking at the nominal
CPU frequency on Fram (E5-2683 v4 @ 2.1GHz), the peak FLOP/s
performance is 2.1 GHz*clock/core * 16 FLOP/clock * 32 cores = 1075
FLOP/s. During the run the cores were actually running at ~2.3-2.4GHz,
hence LINPACK achieves between 80% and 90% of the theoretical
peak. This is a very good result, not often achieved by real-world
codes. Clearly, the code is compute bound.

The same run with profiling reports:

```
$ perf-report -n 32 ./xhpl
[...]
T/V                N    NB     P     Q               Time                 Gflops
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
WR11C2R4       50000   192     4     8              89.73             9.2871e+02
[...]
```

Hence, performance with profiling is roughly 3% lower than
without. While the profiling overhead is not significant, the entire
profiled run (together with setup and final data collection and
interpretation) took much longer than the LINPACK benchmark itself: 15
minutes with profiling vs. 1.5 minute without profiling. This
extension, which might be different for individual codes and depends on the
number of MPI ranks, must be accounted for by the user when submiting
profiled jobs the queuing system.

`perf-report`:

As expected, the code is *Compute-bound*, but there is a visible
communication component. The report correctly suggests that there is
not much to do in terms of per-core optimizations, and that speed
improvements are achievable at scale.

Previous estimates on floating point efficiency have shown that the
code runs at 80-90% of peak FLOP/s performance. However, in the above
report FP operations only account for ~60% of the CPU time, while
the rest is attributed to memory access. As in the case of STREAM,
this is an artifact of profiling: during runtime the memory and
floating point operations are as much as possible overlapped by the
CPU. Hence it is sometimes difficult to say, which class of
instructions is the bottleneck. That's why such a performance report
should be treated with a grain of salt.
