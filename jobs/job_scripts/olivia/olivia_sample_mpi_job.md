# Sample MPI Batch Script

This is an example script for a multi-node MPI job on Olivia's CPU
nodes, using the `NRIS/CPU` (for the CPU compute nodes). If you want
to run instead on the GPU accelerator nodes, use `NRIS/GPU` instead.
(To run in other job types, please read {ref}`job-scripts-on-olivia`.

```{eval-rst}
.. literalinclude:: files/olivia_mpi_job.sh
  :language: bash
```

Download the script:
```{eval-rst}
:download:`files/olivia_mpi_job.sh`
```
