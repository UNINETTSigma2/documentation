# Slurm Parameter and Settings

Slurm supports a multitude of different parameters. This enables you to
effectively tailor your script to your need but also
means that is easy to get lost and waste your time and quota.

The following parameters can be used as command line parameters with
`sbatch` and `srun` or in jobscripts. To use it in a jobscript, start
a newline with `#SBATCH` followed by the parameter. Replace <....>
with the value you want, e.g. `--job-name=test-job`.

See also {ref}`projects-accounting` for more information.

Slurm differs slightly from the previous Torque system with respect to
definitions of various parameters, and what was known as queues in
Torque may be covered by either `--partition=...` or `--qos=...`.

| `--ntasks-per-core=2`              | Enables hyperthreading. Only useful in special circumstances.                                                     |


## Differences between CPUs and tasks

As a new users writing your first Slurm job script the difference
between `--ntasks` and `--cpus-per-taks` is typically quite confusing.
Assuming you want to run your program on a single node with 16 cores
which Slurm parameters should you specify?

The answer is it depends whether the your application supports MPI. MPI
(message passing protocol) is a communication interface used for
developing parallel computing programs on distributed memory systems.
This is necessary for applications running on multiple computers (nodes)
to be able to share (intermediate) results.

To decide which set of parameters you should use, check if your
application utilizes MPI and therefore would benefit from running on
multiple nodes simultaneously. On the other hand you have an non-MPI
enables application or made a mistake in your setup, it doesn't make
sense to request more than one node.

## Settings for OpenMP and MPI jobs

### Single node jobs

For applications that are not optimized for HPC (high performance
computing) systems like simple python or R scripts and a lot of software
which is optimized for desktop PCs.

#### Simple applications and scripts

Many simple tools and scripts are not parallized at all and therefore
won't profit from more than one CPU core.

| Parameter             | Function                                   |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------------   |
| `--nodes=1`           | Start a unparallized job on only one node. |
| `--ntasks-per-node=1` | For OpenMP, only one task is necessary.    |
| `--cpus-per-task=1`   | Just one CPU core will be used.            |
| `--mem=<MB>`          |                                            |

If you are unsure if your application can benefit from more cores try a
higher number and observe the load of your job. If it stays at
approximately one there is no need to ask for more than one.

#### OpenMP applications

OpenMP (Open Multi-Processing) is a multiprocessing library is often
used for programs on shared memory systems. Shared memory describes
systems which share the memory between all processing units (CPU cores),
so that each process can access all data on that system.

| Parameter                              | Function                                                                 |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------                                              |
| `--nodes=1`                            | Start a parallel job for a shared memory system on only one node.        |
| `--ntasks-per-node=1`                  | For OpenMP, only one task is necessary.                                  |
| `--cpus-per-task=<num_threads>`        | Number of threads (CPU cores) to use.                                    |
| `--mem=<MB>`                           | Minimum memory (RAM) per node. Number followed by unit prefix, e.g. 16G. |

### Multiple node jobs (MPI)

For MPI applications.

Depending on the frequency and bandwidth demand of your setup, you can choose two 
distribution schemes:

- Let Slurm determine where to put your parallel MPI tasks as it see fit.

- Force Slurm to group all MPI tasks on whole nodes.

The latter approach of using whole nodes guarantees a low latency and high bandwidth, but it
usually results in a longer queuing time compared to cluster wide job.
With the former approach, the Slurm manager distribute your task to maximize utilization.
This usually results in shorter queuing times but slower inter-task connection speeds and latency. 
What is suitable for you depends entirely on your ability to wait and the requirements of the application
that are set for execution. 

However, if it is suitable for you, we would recommend the former approach as it will make the best use of the resources 
and give the most predictable execution times. If your job requires more than the default
available memory per core (for example 32 GB/node gives 2 GB/core for 16 core nodes
and 1.6GB/core for 20 core nodes) you should adjust this need with the
following command: `#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=4GB`. When doing this, the
batch system will automatically allocate 8 cores or less per node.

#### Task placement on whole nodes

| Parameter                              | Function                                                                                                                      |
| -------------------------------------- | ---------------------------                                                                                                   |
| `--nodes=<num_nodes>`                  | Start a parallel job for a distributed memory system on several nodes.                                                        |
| `--ntasks-per-node=<num_procs>`        | Number of (MPI) processes per node. Maximum number depends on nodes.                                                          |
| `--cpus-per-task=1`                    | Use one CPU core per task.                                                                                                    |
| `--exclusive`                          | Job will not share nodes with other running jobs. You don't need to specify memory as you will get all available on the node. |

#### General task placement

| Parameter                     | Function                                                                      |
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------------                                            |
| `--ntasks=<num_procs>`        | Number of (MPI) processes in total. Equals to the number of cores/            |
| `--mem-per-cpu=<MB>`          | Memory (RAM) per requested CPU core. Number followed by unit prefix, e.g. 2G. |


### Scalability

You should run a few tests to see what is the best fit between
minimizing runtime and maximizing your allocated cpu-quota. That is you
should not ask for more cpus for a job than you really can utilize
efficiently. Try to run your job on 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, etc., cores to see
when the runtime for your job starts tailing off. When you start to see
less than 30% improvement in runtime when doubling the cpu-counts you
should probably not go any further. Recommendations to a few of the most
used applications can be found in sw\_guides.

### A few notes about memory

It is possible to specify the used memory using either `mem` or `mem-per-cpu`. The former can give some surprises in
particular if not used together with `ntasks-per-node`, or another flag to fix the number of cores available to the job.
For instance if you set `mem=300G` and `ntasks=10` you could either get 10 tasks on a node with 300 GB or one task on 
10 nodes, each demanding 300 GB. You are always accounted for the effective CPU time. In this case, say that each CPU has
30 GB available (`memory_per_cpu`). Even though the job only run on one CPU per node, you are accounted for 300/`memory_per_cpu` GB, meaning 10 CPUs.
In total you are thus accounted for the usage of 100 CPUs.

### Troubleshooting

#### "srun: Warning: can't honor --ntasks-per-node set to _X_ which doesn't match the requested tasks _Y_ with the number of requested nodes _Y_. Ignoring --ntasks-per-node."

This warning appears when using the `mpirun` command with Intel MPI and
specifying `--ntasks-per-node` for jobs in the `normal` partition on Fram.  As
far as we have seen, the job does *not* ignore the `--ntasks-per-node`, and
will run the specified number of processes per node.  You can test it with,
e.g., `mpirun hostname`.  Please let us know if you have an example where
`--ntasks-per-node` is *not* honored!

So, if you get this when using `mpirun` with Intel MPI, our recommendation is
currently that the warning can be ignored.
